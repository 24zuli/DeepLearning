-> Perceptron:-
   A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that serves as the simplest form of a neural network, specifically designed for binary classification tasks. It operates as a single-layer classifier, meaning it consists of only one layer of output nodes directly connected to the input features. The perceptron model can be mathematically represented as follows:

1. Weighted Sum Calculation:
- The perceptron computes a weighted sum of its inputs:

where:
- z is the weighted sum,
- w<sub>i</sub> are the weights corresponding to each input,
- x<sub>i</sub> are the input features,
- b is the bias term.
